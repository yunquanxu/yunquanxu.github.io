[00:00:00] Hi, you're listening to, I'd rather be writing.com. I'm Tom Johnson. And today I have a quick productivity tip. This is something that I was trying out last week and the week before. And I've noticed that it actually works quite well. Um, and productivity is one of these topics I like to return to on my blog again and again.
</p>
<p>
[00:00:24] And, uh, I'm not going to belabor the point here. The tip is simple. Uh, Set a timer for four hours, essentially broken up into one hour increments and within each hour increment focus on some writing task. And when you. Uh, get distracted or have to attend to an email or some other tasks such as a meeting, stop the timer.
</p>
<p>
[00:00:51] And when you return to the writing task, start the timer again. Now I've got up here, a nice little app that a Mac app called focus, but there are a million of these little timer apps. I mean, really. Just a timer app will do, but this one is kind of cool. Um, you can set how many sessions you want and I've said, and how long each session should be.
</p>
<p>
[00:01:14] So I've set four sessions, uh, each for 60 minutes. I mean, I don't know why 60 minutes, why not just one, four hour session, but it seems a little bit more manageable this way. And, uh, yeah, I'll, I'll pick out a writing task, say, Hey, we've got this documentation task. And as soon as that timer is going, so I come focusing on it.
</p>
<p>
[00:01:35] Now this actually gets into another question. His, what exactly does it mean to be writing? Because, uh, assuming that you're, you've got this timer going and I'm, and I'm writing. What happens if I hit a roadblock and I don't have certain information, maybe I need to set up a meeting with engineers to get it.
</p>
<p>
[00:01:58] Or maybe I've written something. It's time to review what I've written with the engineers. Um, or maybe it's something I have to learn. Maybe I came across a new concept and all of a sudden I'm like, man, I've got to figure out what this means. Right. So, um, At that point, are you still writing, you know, if you're not heads down typing, right.
</p>
<p>
[00:02:23] But you're still gathering information for that task, I would say. Yes, of course. Um, this is all part of the writing process. I think, uh, you know, A lot of people try to reduce writing to just like actually typing, which, uh, uh, doesn't make a lot of sense to me. Right. So as long as you're researching, you're gathering information, you're interviewing, you're interfacing with engineers, even if you're set up a meeting to meet with engineers, to ask them questions so that you can get unblocked for whatever you're writing.
</p>
<p>
[00:02:54] I think that's writing it's part of the information process. Anyway, um, this timer. It's so dead simple, but it works because it's so easy to get distracted. There's a, you know, instant message through whatever client you have a, we use chimes. So people are chiming me all the time, and then you get emails that you have to respond to and meetings and, you know, uh, it seems kind of crazy that only four hours on my day to day would be.
</p>
<p>
[00:03:28] Dedicated to writing, you know, what happens to the other four hours? And I started tracking them. I was like, let me keep an actual log to see what exactly I'm doing with all this non-writing time. And some of these tasks, uh, some of these tasks were. Checking email, uh, reviewing writing samples from candidates, reviewing project plans, uh, reviewing meeting with my manager for a one-on-one, uh, responding to email about whether certain projects are on my radar.
</p>
<p>
[00:04:05] If I'm aware of them getting files from developers, for testing, uh, creating an internal center of excellence type site, uh, listening in on. Stand ups and participating in standups, I'm doing a doc calendar, you know, shuffling, who's gonna tackle which projects sending field engineers links to things now like it's kind of endless.
</p>
<p>
[00:04:30] Um, and all these tasks, tasks are important. I'm not saying they're not important, but unless I can just kind of focus in on one specific writing task and sort of have a timer that. Pulls me back to it and reminds me that yeah, you're, you're supposed to be writing, you know, not attending to all this, um, secondary stuff.
</p>
<p>
[00:04:54] It's really helpful. Like it works. And, and I had this sort of epiphany last [00:05:00] last week where, because I was able to get so much done, uh, using this method, even though I had all these. Projects on my plate, just like tons of stuffed dumped, dumped on my plate. And I was like, usually I would feel really overwhelmed.
</p>
<p>
[00:05:16] Well, not really overwhelmed, but you know, the sense of stress and like, Oh, better break out the calendar and plan it out. But this time I was thinking, you know, what if I just hit four hours a day working on this stuff, I'm going to chew through it, like in no time and all the stress kind of evaporated now.
</p>
<p>
[00:05:36] This is still early in my experiment. So maybe I'm just naive and maybe this is yet another productivity tip that will, you know, uh, fail or fall by the wayside. But I mean, I strongly value writing. I really like writing, even though I'm recording a video cast right now. Um, I really like writing. So, uh, I guess internally, I also have motivation to follow this writing timer.
</p>
<p>
[00:06:00] Um, Yeah. So it's a quick tip now. Uh, if you're on a Mac, this focus app is pretty good, but there's probably 20 different timer apps. There's a larger technique called the Pomodoro technique, which also works well. It says just a Pomodoro, I believe is Italian for tomato, refers to the tomato timer where you'd set 20 minute timer.
</p>
<p>
[00:06:22] You know, the little thing that you twist and it ticks down well, um, No. The idea is that you, you have these focus sessions where you radically, you block out all distractions. So if you really wanted to get serious, you could set a timer for an hour and shut down your email and your instant message client and not attend any meetings.
</p>
<p>
[00:06:42] Right. And so, um, yeah, I mean, if you're, if you're heads down on some task, uh, that's definitely a strategy that you probably want to follow. You know, if it's really important. On the other hand though, I kinda like to make myself accessible, especially when engineers ping me or I just want to be able to, uh, interact with people in the moment that they needed information or that I need information from them because.
</p>
<p>
[00:07:06] I really want to interact with them. So at any rate, if it gets too crazy, yeah. I shut this down. Sometimes I shut down my email for an hour and go back online and I've got like 20 messages and things are falling apart and it's like, Oh my gosh. But, uh, anyway, give this tip a try if you want, if you're into this.
</p>
<p>
[00:07:25] Um, and I'm interested to learn productivity tips that you have for writing. You know, uh, this productivity tip is basically just to do the writing. It's not any secret hack, uh, but this app definitely helps you keep on focus. Uh, if you like video casts, let me know. I'm just sort of experimenting with this and I'm thinking about doing them more, but, um, I'm not really a video person.
</p>
<p>
[00:07:51] I'm not photogenic. I'm not very articulate and in, uh, uh, video casts like this, but maybe it's something I can work on and get better at. You can follow my blog at I'd rather be writing.com. And again, my name is Tom Johnson. Thanks.
