<p>Ian Koss is founder of <a href="http://ink19.com/">Ink19</a>, which was at one time one of the largest free music magazines in the U.S. His team began publishing in the early 90's in the traditional print medium, but changed to an online format as the Internet emerged. In this podcast, Ian explains how the online medium required their writers to rethink and restructure their writing.</p>
<p>In this podcast, Ian talks about such topics as the transience of print versus the permanence of content online, attention spans, online structure and layout, metadata, search engine optimization, semantic markup, single-sourcing and XML, readership anonymity, tracking users, profitability, banner ads, linking, designing for a range, milisecond judgment, the sense of incompleteness, and unpredictability.</source></audio></p>
