description: "I added three topics to a new section in my API doc course called \"Balancing product overviews with getting started tutorials.\" I'm still adding to this section but wanted to share the current content. These are all first drafts that I hope to refine a bit with more imagery, proofreading, examples, and other detail, so if you have feedback, let me know in the comments. I'm trying to explore reasons why these two content types often fail or are weak. It's less of a best practices section and more like an analysis about causes."

Here are the new pages:

* [Reasons why product overviews are often minimal or nonexistent](/learnapidoc/docapis_reasons_for_anemic_overviews.html)
* [Reasons why getting started tutorials fail or don't exist](/learnapidoc/docapis_reasons_for_bad_getting_started_tutorials.html)
