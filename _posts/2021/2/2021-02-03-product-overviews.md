Here's the intro:

> The product overview (usually the homepage of your product’s documentation) explains what you can do with the product, including the high-level business goals, the market needs or pain points it solves, who the product or other features are for, and other introductory information.
>
> Although a seemingly simple page, the product overview can overlap into marketing domains, create redundancies with README’s, and pose challenges in connecting with a more diverse audience (both engineers and bizdev people) than the rest of your technical docs. Overall, the product overview is an area where documentation and marketing intersect in interesting ways.
