description: "I revisited the original page on glossaries in my API doc course -- see <a href='/learnapidoc/docapis_glossary_section.html'>API glossaries</a> -- and expanded the content with many technical examples about how to single source glossary content from a single YAML file. I added examples for integrating tooltips and popovers as well, added more discussion, analysis, additional reading, and other updates overall. Although this page appears within my API course, the content could be applied to non-API docs and sites as well."
