description: "I added a new article in my API documentation course about processes for changing internal doc culture. One of the most influential aspects that will determine your experience as a technical writer is the company's documentation culture and environment. If you find yourself in an organization with a poor documentation culture, it can be difficult if not impossible to change it. Poor documentation culture/environments lead to a high turnover on doc teams, loss of motivation for existing writers (especially as their colleagues constantly leave, which increases the workload), and contributes to a downward spiral of tasks you can never quite get a handle on. In this topic, I outline six strategies you can implement to influence change in your company's documentation culture."
