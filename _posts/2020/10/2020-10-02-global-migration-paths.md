This past week I have been thinking about whether to move out of California. I live near Sunnyvale (south of San Francisco about 30 miles) and have been here about 7 years. Before California, I lived in Utah for about 5 years, and before that, Florida for about the same. Before that, Cairo, and before that, New York, and before that, Washington State (where I grew up).

Nearly every relocation has been related to work or school. While moving out of California after living here for this many years fits my own migration pattern, I also think there's evidence of a larger trend away from urban centers that is being driven by the pandemic. But I'm not sure, and I want to think through some ideas in this post. Ultimately, my question is this: Does Silicon Valley or some other), or have world events (not just the pandemic WFH, but climate change and other factors) prompted us to a more virtual model? When the pandemic is over, will we all go back to work, or are we actually never going back to work? The answer to that question -- what happens when the pandemic ends -- is driving a ton of thought about where people live.

I remember back in March when I first received the WFH order. I remember clearing out my desk, packing up my computer and other belongings, leaving a mostly empty office. I had a weird feeling that maybe this wouldn't be temporary. Maybe I was looking at this office space for the last time. Six months later, that premonition still rings somewhat true. But is it? When the pandemic ends, will I return to the empty desk and set up my things once again?

To answer this question, I'll explore it from several angles.

## Purchase of electronics and tech equipment/services

The first question is whether it makes economic sense for companies to encourage work from home scenarios. The last six months have proven that tech companies can thrive in a WFH environment. The tech industry itself blossoms in this arrangement. First off, people in general purchase a lot more electronics (computers, web cams, routers, etc.) to set up functional offices and schools from home. The working environment becomes one in which your computer is a terminal to the world. Most everyone in the family now has his or her own computer and other equipment. Not all sales of tech are up due to home office equipment purchases, though, so this is likely a small segment that benefits companies like Best Buy.

## Reduction of office space costs

Companies could reduce the expense of maintaining elaborate offices and campuses for employees. I don't know how much office space costs companies, or cafeterias and parking garages, but it's a percentage of the cost associated with each employee. If companies could remove this office expense, wouldn't they welcome it? Currently, companies still have giant offices that they are maintaining, but eventually, they could potentially reduce the amount of space they need.

Some companies have floated the idea of "hot desks," where they aren't dedicated to the same employees but are used by the employees in the office at that time. In that model, you could have a smaller campus that is shared by employees who come into work at different times.

But generally speaking, if you don't need office space for your employees, this should reduce some expenses. Everyone seems to be supplying their own home office instead.

## Productivity

Work hasn't slowed down with the pandemic. If anything, it has increased, in part because no one is taking vacations, and the general pace of projects seems to continue either as usual or at an increased pace. However, it's unclear whether productivity is boosted due to the pandemic rather than working from home conditions. During the pandemic, there's not a lot else going on, so many people naturally gravitate to work for meaning.

Working from home, I wouldn't have guessed that work-life balance would be the thing I struggle with most. It's not just about setting boundaries between work and personal time, or figuring out when to exit the virtual office and interact with the family. It's that without other events (soccer games, playing basketball at that park, community events, trips to the beach), there's a lack of things going on. As such, I naturally gravitate to work projects and end up working on them at irregular schedules. The last three weekends I worked off and on finishing a project that that had an aggressive due date. But strangely, I almost didn't mind -- it gave me something to do. Going forward, I plan to break out of this cycle where work and personal life blur together.

During non-pandemic times, where you do actually have events going on, who's to say that productivity would be the same? If I could go to a gym during the day, drive to the beach, browse a museum, etc., I might not be focusing so much time on work projects. However, I wouldn't have the time sink of a commute. Then again, the commute is what helps me mentally separate work versus personal life.

## Salary reductions

Another economic motivator might be that companies can pay employees located in lower-cost of living areas a smaller salary. For example, you could pay your employee based in Wyoming a smaller salary than your employee based in New York City. The argument about salary reductions becomes somewhat unjustified, though, if both the New York City employee and Wyoming employee are both virtual, doing the same work. If the New York City employee was going into an office every day, while the Wyoming employee did not, that might be an argument. But a model where everyone is virtual but paid by cost-of-living doesn't make much sense.

## Talent recruitment

Probably the biggest advantage is talent recruitment. If you're not limited to the vicinity around your company, presumably you could hire across the globe to find the talent you need. In the hiring processes I've participated in, many well-qualified candidates were interested in positions but unable or unwilling to relocate. In some ways, settling for the talent available in the same general zip code


what about entirely virtual companies? Automattic


Overall, are companies economically motivated to embrace a WFH model due to profit incentives? The cost savings is probably not significant enough influence any work paradigm shifts here.

## Climate change




Part of the feeling of being trapped at home is due to the poor AQI, which fluctuates based on whether there's a nearby fire or not. When I came to California seven years ago, I arrived at the beginning of a severe two year drought. The drought conditions gave rise to other environmental issues, like beetles devouring forests, which then made fire conditions more prone, and then the dry lightening storms lit the state on fire.


But it's not just California. Climate change is prompting people to move away from affected areas. In [How Climate Migration Will Reshape America](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/09/15/magazine/climate-crisis-migration-america.html), Abrham Lustgarten explores how climate change is influencing a massive migration and change across the country. Abrham writes:

> For two years, I have been studying how climate change will influence global migration. My sense was that of all the devastating consequences of a warming planet — changing landscapes, pandemics, mass extinctions — the potential movement of hundreds of millions of climate refugees across the planet stands to be among the most important. I traveled across four countries to witness how rising temperatures were driving climate refugees away from some of the poorest and hottest parts of the world. I had also helped create an enormous computer simulation to analyze how global demographics might shift, and now I was working on a data-mapping project about migration here in the United States.
>
> So it was with some sense of recognition that I faced the fires these last few weeks. In recent years, summer has brought a season of fear to California, with ever-worsening wildfires closing in. But this year felt different. The hopelessness of the pattern was now clear, and the pandemic had already uprooted so many Americans. Relocation no longer seemed like such a distant prospect. Like the subjects of my reporting, climate change had found me, its indiscriminate forces erasing all semblance of normalcy. Suddenly I had to ask myself the very question I’d been asking others: Was it time to move?

The author starts with California's fires but expands to the worsening environmental changes across the country, from rising seas, hurricanes, floods, crop-destroying droughts, record heat waves, and more. Phoenix had nearly two months of 110-degree heat, exceeding previous heat waves by 20 days. People will migrate in part to escape the hellscape they find themselves in, seeking cooler, wetter, milder, safer climates.

The author interviewed four dozen experts to find out if we're undergoing mass global migration due to climate change. He says a 2018 study found that 1 in 12 Americans will move to the West coast, Mountain West, or Northwest over the next 45 years. What will happen as large numbers of people migrate to these areas?

> Such a shift in population is likely to increase poverty and widen the gulf between the rich and the poor. It will accelerate rapid, perhaps chaotic, urbanization of cities ill-equipped for the burden, testing their capacity to provide basic services and amplifying existing inequities.

The author argues that wealth can be an insulator from the devastating realities of climate change, as we can build sea walls or divert water from other sources, buy air conditioners, etc. Poorer communities more subject to direct effects of climate change will migrate. Heat waves, polluted water, water shortages, mega fires, extreme humidity, crop failures, rising sea levels, and more will drive people away from their communities and homes elsewhere.

The article is dense with facts and references, drawing connections between insurance companies folding (due to natural disasters that that spike insurance claims), failing banks, and so on. The author concludes,

> Once you accept that climate change is fast making large parts of the United States nearly uninhabitable, the future looks like this: With time, the bottom half of the country grows inhospitable, dangerous and hot. Something like a tenth of the people who live in the South and the Southwest — from South Carolina to Alabama to Texas to Southern California — decide to move north in search of a better economy and a more temperate environment. Those who stay behind are disproportionately poor and elderly.
>
> In these places, heat alone will cause as many as 80 additional deaths per 100,000 people — the nation’s opioid crisis, by comparison, produces 15 additional deaths per 100,000. The most affected people, meanwhile, will pay 20 percent more for energy, and their crops will yield half as much food or in some cases virtually none at all. That collective burden will drag down regional incomes by roughly 10 percent, amounting to one of the largest transfers of wealth in American history, as people who live farther north will benefit from that change and see their fortunes rise.
>
> The millions of people moving north will mostly head to the cities of the Northeast and Northwest, which will see their populations grow by roughly 10 percent, according to one model. Once-chilly places like Minnesota and Michigan and Vermont will become more temperate, verdant and inviting.

The author seems to be wrestling with the my same question -- should I move? Abrham spoke with Jesse Keenan, a climate change specialist, for the research in the article. The author says during one conversation, he started to ask, "Should I be selling my house and getting — ". Keenan cut him off before even finishing the question: "Yes."

People are already leaving Silicon Valley in droves. Yet, it's not as if housing prices have come down. There are more incentives for renting in some places (e.g., first month free), but houses still cost more than is affordable to any normal family, and rent is sky high as well. So maybe there's not quite a mass exodus yet. What scares me is how quickly markets can flip. Things can change overnight. We're experiencing life at an accelerated pace. In [More people are leaving California than ever before, driven out by worsening wildfires, politics and the skyrocketing cost of living](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8727961/More-people-leaving-California-wildfires-high-costs-politics.html), the author writes:

> According to Census data in 2018 more than 86,000 people left California for Texas, nearly 70,000 left for Arizona and about 55,000 left for Washington, according to NBC.
>
> People making $55,000 or less a year were mostly moving out of California between 2007 and 2016 while people making more than $200,000 a year moved in, according to the US Census Bureau.

The influx of high-income earners moving in, and low-income moving out, might explain the stability in the housing/rental market, I guess.

## Hybrid models
https://www.businessinsider.com/google-office-future-employee-on-sites-sundar-pichai-2020-9


## Pollution
commuting restrictions california

## 3 years of working in isolation at amazon
interfacing with teams elsewhere

## what is so magical about the office?
separation of work and home
camaraderie - coffee chats didn't replace that
standups where you can hear people
more inclusion in meetings, updates.

## what does employer get for on-site?
more expenses for the office space and campus
operating costs versus employers pay this
less productivity due to commute times
more employee selection -- lots of talent not near company that you can now choose from
cheaper salaries
who cares about team morale

After being work from home 100% right now, I really would prefer a hybrid 4 in and 1 out. I believe there was a Gallup poll that showed majority also do not want to work from home always.
4 and 1 does have benefits, commuting 1 hour once a week compared to 5 times a week is a big difference. The reason I would like to go to the office one time a week is really I feel extremely disconnected from my team when always being remote. Teams is good and all but just not the same as being in a room with people.

And what about spending the winter in some sunny island for a month? Getting to know the team when one starts is good, and then just working with the tools to meet and talk to them. But my impression is that most of the people who think like you do that because they miss the human contact with people outside of their household (not saying you in particular) and they feel isolated.
I have been working fully remote almost 2 years now, and it felt that way at the beginning. Until I started using the benefits that remote work provides. Going to a nearby gym with cheap prices at my convenience, staying in other places for a month without having to ask for holidays (or even ask for it), joining plans and trips with friends without worrying too much if I have enough holidays or even getting advantage of cheap prices for flights and trains to travel somewhere.

I think most people struggle with the reality that the only "downside" of remote work is not "being disconnected with the team", but having to put effort to meet friends (also make new ones) to have the human contact they usually miss.

For people who live close, they still have to work from home, thus not avoiding the cost of it (higher utility fee, no company dining, need more space). For them, this is definitely more expensive than work onsite all the time.

I was a believer in office work being superior to working from home. Then with covid I had to work from home. I hated it for the first 2 months. Then perhaps I became institutionalized because now I prefer it. Without a commute I have more time for sleep and child care related things. Plus I am more focused.
If the office ever reopens then I will probably only go in one or two days a week, and all of my employees can choose their own schedules also. We will just mandate coming in for certain meetings.

I'm the opposite. I used to think working from home would be great, and that the office was fairly irrelevant given all my work was on a computer anyway.
Six months in, the main thing that this experience has taught me is that I never want to work a remote job. It's miserable.

It's worth noting that this is NOT what remote working is really like. During regular times you can more easily go work in your local cafe for a few hours, more easily hang out with your friends after work to get socialization. If you're a social person this is a double-whammy, you lost socializing at work and socializing with friends at the same time. I'm not suggesting you would ever like normal remote work, I have no idea. I just wanted to say this isn't what remote work is really like.

Strange, I had the opposite experience - hated working remote in the past but been mostly OK with WFH during COVID - I think the main reason is that during COVID everyone else was also working from home, not just me. So the company had to come up with procedures that suit well remote workers, and I never felt "out of the loop" compared to others.

I find being "out of the loop" to be one of the best parts of being remote. Whatever small amount of useful things I'm out of the loop on is dwarfed by the benefit of being out of the loop on all the political/personal drama. Of course this is a very individual experience so everyone's mileage will vary greatly.

I'm the opposite. Married with 2 kids, but I had to rent a private office 10 minutes from home so I could focus.
I was setting a bad precedent for my sons when they would try to talk to me and I'd say "I'm working. not right now." Then it becomes ambiguous whether they can talk to me or not. Not good for kids IMO.

Now when I come home i get the biggest hugs you've ever seen and we start playing

I’m on paternity leave right now with my first kid. I worked a little bit before taking the leave and that was all the time I needed to determine that having a separate “office” is a must. We’re moving away from the Bay Area to be closer to family, and I’m seriously thinking about purchasing a cheap ($40-$60k) hut/cottage with a pretty view about ten minutes away from wherever home ends up being. I’ll set up a desk, couch, espresso machine, and treat that as “work”.

Well in that case the problem isn't "working from home", its "working from this particular home which isn't setup in any way for success". Its not reasonable to expect everyone to have a living situation setup to accommodate working from home given the way the current situation was thrust upon them, but its just an unreasonable to judge the efficacy of working from home based on those same people's experiences. Its equivalent to removing all the desks and furniture from an office and then basing your assessment on the ensuing disaster.

Same. My coworkers who have young children at home seem pretty miserable.
I have a coworker that I haven't seen for weeks now because of their new part-time job as a homeschool teacher.

Childless couples and single people seem pretty happy with their new free time, even if they’d eventually like to return to the office.

What it seems to be is that people prefer having people around for part of the day but not in their way while working. People with families but no office to get away from everyone struggle and people alone 24/7 struggle.
Personally I live with 4 other family members but have a dedicated room with a dual monitor setup so I find this to be ideal.

We have family watching the kids during the day, and if we didn't we would hire help. But even with help, it's just easier not having to commute, being able to do laundry / chores / etc. while taking meetings, etc. I am more productive overall.

Opposite experience, the ones with kids need some other space where they can concentrate.

If you're married with children, you most likely have less than zero need for an office-based social life.

IMHO biggest variable is company itself. If it’s not setup as remote & distributed-first, then you going to suffer. Same with what you actually do. Developing a product is much easier alone than a service in a consulting company.

> I'm a very enthusiastic engineer and love bouncing ideas off others, whether they are in sales, marketing, or other engineers. Remote has made "connecting" much less natural and makes it difficult to progress in my career.
What's your strategy to counteract this if the people who you enjoy bouncing ideas off of prefer to and/or end up all staying remote?

For me it's mostly about ease of collaboration. I love hashing out math/design problems on a whiteboard. Even with good tools there's nothing that allows the same sort of natural, dynamic conversation. Meetings turn into a series of loosely connected speeches, especially when there's large numbers.
I also find that simple conversations take way longer, especially when there's disagreement.

Thirdly video calls are super draining.

It's also really difficult to get separation between work and life. I find myself doing home chores doing the day intertwined with work.

Unlike some commenter, the social aspect isn't that important to me, but there's definitely some camaraderie missing. In the office, I feel like part of a team that's working together to achieve something. At home I feel like one of a swarm of drones that occasionally communicate for information exchange. It's not very fulfilling.

This has been a HUGE PLUS for me! Just the ability to run a load of laundry while on a 90 minute call or water the plants when I have a gap between meetings has been a major quality of life increase. Now I can manage the house during the week and weekends are true relaxing and enjoyable weekends, no longer chorefests.

Post COVID, my current company is in the process of re-imagining office work, more towards intense collaboration spaces. Most of the work can still be done remotely, getting together for specific activities every once in a while. I really believe this model could represent the future for this type of work in tech.

- Those at home alone all day miss the social contact they got from being in the office.

- Those with kids and other distractions at home are annoyed because it interferes with focus.

- Those with a quiet home that includes other people are often quite happy with the work from home situation.

I'm in the last group and I'm happy and I'm with you on frequency. I'd prefer to only go in 1-2 days per week and live much further from the office.

Because the rent in SF and NY is insane and there is no way they can afford enough space for most people to have offices. So they make up BS about the reason being how great the open office is for collaboration.

I'm sure I'm speaking solely for myself here but there are people in this industry whose job function seems to mostly involve constantly distracting engineers from producing output by incessantly asking how things are coming along and filling everyone's day with meetings that achieve nothing other than breaking flow and sapping productivity.

I didn't realise until I started working from home just how much of my day is leeched away like this and it's jaw dropping how much more productive I am when I can just pull my work for a day, actually do my work, and then get it committed.

Wait, sitting at an office and still using Slack makes on-site work much different than remote? You think in-person meetings at work are productive? I can't forget the nice excuse to have an hour-long meeting, which lasted only 15 minutes, but people had a proof on their calendar that they "worked" for an hour. Or "starting work" at 9am... but really having coffee and eating breakfast until 10am... or having a 2-hour lunch break, which was supposed to be just one hour. Oh, wait, it was a working lunch. Although offices open at 9am, nobody dared to schedule meetings before 10am or in the 1pm-2pm interval for the above-mentioned reason. Can't forget also the blood-sugar spike right after lunch when people were falling asleep during the afternoon meetings.
I've been working remotely in the past 10+ years and I'm never looking into on-site work again! The time "invested" in commute with all the risks associated with driving are not worth it - even if it pays slightly better. But usually it doesn't. For example, in Orange County, CA you can't find a well-paying job - the best jobs are remote and OC is not a fringe case!

Remote work is the nightmare of micromanagers! Everybody else loves remote work!
