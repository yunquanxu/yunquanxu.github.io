description: "I added an article about content strategy for the developer experience to my API doc course. As the content grows on a developer portal, there's an increasing need for some technical writers to expand their documentation roles from individual contributors creating and publishing new content to dedicated content strategists instead. These dedicated content strategists manage the processes, standards, tools, governance, and workflows for the content that is primarily authored by contributing teams. You can read the article here: <a href='/learnapidoc/docapis_dx_content_strategy.html'>DX content strategy with developer portals</a>."

(Note that I had an earlier blog post titled [From API docs to developer portals](/blog/from-api-docs-to-developer-portals/). I mostly expanded on the role description, refined the points mentioned there, and incorporated them into the course.)
