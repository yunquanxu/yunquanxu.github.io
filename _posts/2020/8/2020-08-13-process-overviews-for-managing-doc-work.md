description: "Lately I've been thinking about processes for managing documentation work, and I decided to describe in detail a couple of different workflows -- a process for managing large documentation projects, and another process for managing small documentation requests."

You can read these two new articles here:

* [Managing large documentation projects](/learnapidoc/docapis_managing_doc_projects.html)
* [Managing small documentation requests](/learnapidoc/docapis_managing_small_doc_requests.html)

I added these two processes into a new section in my [API documentation course](/learnapidoc/) called [Managing developer portals](/learnapidoc/docapis_managing_doc_processes_and_developer_portals.html). In that section, I plan to add other info here about managing developer portals, including managing the SDK release process, the documentation review process, and more. I mentioned a general list of some of these topics in [From API docs to developer portals](/blog/from-api-docs-to-developer-portals).
