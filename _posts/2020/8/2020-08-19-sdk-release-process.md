description: "I added a new article covering SDK release processes in my API course. Even if engineering teams distribute the SDKs, they often look to tech writers for guidance on the Readme, signoff, and other input. The process in the article describes a few callouts that you should look for before distributing SDKs and other code artifacts. You can read the article here: <a href='/learnapidoc/docapis_managing_sdk_releases.html'>Processes for managing SDK releases</a>."
