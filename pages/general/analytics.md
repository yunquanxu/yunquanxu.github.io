If you're thinking of [advertising on idratherbewriting.com](/advertising/), it's important to get a sense of the traffic and analytics of the audience so that your ad not only has visibility, but visibility with the right audience.

In 2020, idratherbewriting.com had 1,814,770 page views, or about 4,971 page views a day (207 page views an hour). More specifically, users created 1,195,729 sessions, with 1.52 pages per session and an average of 1:25 minutes per session.

## Overall page views

Here's a breakdown of site traffic analytics on idratherbewriting.com from Jan 1, 2019 through Dec 31, 2019, according to Google Analytics. The blue line represents 2019, while the brown line represents 2014 for comparison.

<figure><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/2020overallanalyticsgraph.png" alt="Site traffic graph" /> <figcaption>I'd Rather Be Writing received 1,814,770 page views during 2020. This equates to nearly 5,000 page views a day.</figcaption></figure>

{{site.data.alerts.note}}A "page view" is when the page loads, regardless of whether it's the same visitor or a different visitor. A "session" refers to a <i>unique visit</i> to the site. If the same visitor views 10 pages, it only counts as a single session. The average number of page views per session is 1.52.{{site.data.alerts.end}}

For historical comparison, here's a graph that shows the growth of the site from its inception in 2006 through 2020.

Traffic was fairly consistent from 2010 through 2017. In 2017, I added the [API documentation site](/learnapidoc/), which accounted for a lot of growth.

## Analytics breakdown {#analytics-breakdown}

The following table includes more details from other Google Analytics reports. To make the data more meaningful, I've provided data from 2018, 2019, and 2020 to compare the changes from one year to the next. I also round data to the nearest whole number (e.g., 1.51% is rounded to 2%; 1.49% is rounded to 1%).

All of this information is provided through Google Analytics by default. (I don't have any special scripts or other tracking cookies other than what Google adds through Google Analytics. Also note that I'm not sure how Google tracks age and gender. Google also tracks hobby categories, though I haven't shown it here.)

## API doc traffic percentage

In 2018, 59% of my site traffic came to my API documentation site ([/learnapidoc/](/learnapidoc/). In 2019, that percentage jumped up to 72%. In 2019, this percentage further climbed to 75%.

Here's a graph showing the percentage in 2019:

<figure><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/learnapidoc_traffic3v2.png" alt="API documentation traffic" /> <figcaption>The traffic to my <a href='/learnapidoc/'>API documentation site</a> accounted for about 72% of the overall site traffic in 2019.</figcaption></figure>

And then in 2020:

<figure><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/2021analyticstrafficeapisource.png" alt="API documentation traffic" /> <figcaption>The traffic to my <a href='/learnapidoc/'>API documentation site</a> accounted for about 75% of the overall site traffic in 2020.</figcaption></figure>

The traffic from the API documentation visitors is outperforming other traffic sources, with 3 out of every 4 visitors going to the API documentation site.

## Quality of impressions

The quality of impressions depends on the influence of the site. Impressions from a highly influential site carry more weight than impressions from a less influential site. In earlier years, several companies ranked the most influential bloggers in tech comm. Their categories shifted more broadly and eventually people stopped creating these influencer lists. Links to previous rankings are below.
