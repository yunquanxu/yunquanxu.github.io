<p>User-centered documentation includes documentation that prioritizes the user's tasks and other goals as a means of organizing and directing documentation. The documentation isn't organized by the order of tabs in the UI or even by the tasks that the product team thinks are important. Instead, all organization and content is dictated by the user's goals and needs.</p>
<p>The following content is in the <b>user-centered-documentation</b> category:

    {% for p in site.categories.user-centered-documentation %}
<h4 class="categoryArchive"><a href="{{ p.url | prepend: site.baseurl }}">{{p.title}}</a> <span class="postDate"> | {{ p.date | date: "%b %-d, %Y" }}</span>
</h4>
{% endfor %}
