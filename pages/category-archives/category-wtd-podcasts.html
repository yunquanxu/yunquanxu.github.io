<p>The WTD podcasts category contains reposted episodes for the Write the Docs podcast. See <a href='https://podcast.writethedocs.org/'>Write the Docs Podcast</a> for the original content here. I usually just post summaries of each episode here. Note that the <a href='https://idratherbewriting.com/itunes.rss'>I'd Rather Be Writing audio feed</a> doesn't contain MP3 files from the Write the Docs podcast. You have to <a href='https://podcast.writethedocs.org/how-to-subscribe/'>subscribe to the WTD podcast</a> for the audio feed.</p>
