<p>This category explores book reviews and other sorts of reviews. Admittedly, there aren't many books that I've reviewed here, but when I do review something, I'll tag it with this.</p>

<p>The following content is in the <b>book-reviews</b> category:

    {% for p in site.categories.book-reviews %}
<h4 class="categoryArchive"><a href="{{ p.url | prepend: site.baseurl }}">{{p.title}}</a> <span class="postDate"> | {{ p.date | date: "%b %-d, %Y" }}</span>
</h4>
{% endfor %}
