<p>DITA stands for Darwin Information Typing Architecture and refers to a specific XML schema or structure for creating content. Think of it as a template for filling out the essential parts of help. I don't currently use DITA, but in the past I compared DITA with Jekyll and other tools, and explored some of the shortcomings of DITA's information architecture.</p>

<p>The following content is in the <b>dita</b> category:

    {% for p in site.categories.dita %}
<h4 class="categoryArchive"><a href="{{ p.url | prepend: site.baseurl }}">{{p.title}}</a> <span class="postDate"> | {{ p.date | date: "%b %-d, %Y" }}</span>
</h4>
{% endfor %}
