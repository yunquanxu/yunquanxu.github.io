<p>Simplifying complexity is the name of a series of posts I wrote following this thread. The posts aim to dig deeper into this core motto that many technical writers herald as their prime goal and value to technical projects: reducing the complexity of information into language that is easy to read, steps that are easy to follow, so that users can have success.</p>
<p>The following content is in the <b>simplifying-complexity</b> category:

    {% for p in site.categories.simplifying-complexity %}
<h4 class="categoryArchive"><a href="{{ p.url | prepend: site.baseurl }}">{{p.title}}</a> <span class="postDate"> | {{ p.date | date: "%b %-d, %Y" }}</span>
</h4>
{% endfor %}
