<p>The family category is a personal category that includes non-tech-comm-related posts; instead, I write about family-related topics and events. This category is intended more like a personal journal related to family.</p>

<p>The following content is in the <b>family</b> category:

    {% for p in site.categories.family %}
<h4 class="categoryArchive"><a href="{{ p.url | prepend: site.baseurl }}">{{p.title}}</a> <span class="postDate"> | {{ p.date | date: "%b %-d, %Y" }}</span>
</h4>
{% endfor %}
